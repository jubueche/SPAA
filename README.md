# Adversarial Attacks on Spiking Convolutional Networks for Event-based Vision
Repository containing the code for the paper "Adversarial Attacks on Spiking Convolutional Networks for Event-based Vision".

## Setup
- Install cleverhans using ```pip install git+https://github.com/cleverhans-lab/cleverhans.git#egg=cleverhans```
- Install Sinabs ```pip install sinabs```
- Install pytorch ```pip install torch ujson gdown```
- Install aermanager ```pip install aermanager```

## Tutorials
There are a couple of tutorials in the repository named `tutorial_*.py`. These make a good entry point to see if everything is setup correctly.

## Rerunning the experiments
Each (and more) experiments that are reported in the paper (except for the on-chip results for anonymisation reasons) were generated by running ```python make_figures.py```.

You can also re-run (recommended) individual experiments by uncommenting the experiment in ```quick_access.py``` and simply run using ```python quick_access.py```.
